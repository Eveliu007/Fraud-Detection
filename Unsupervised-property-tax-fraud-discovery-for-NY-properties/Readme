1. Objective
   Our analytics team is hired by the city of New York to find anomalies in NY property data. The whole data set consists of over one million records with
factors defining property valuation and assessment. We practiced two unsupervised machine learning models (Heuristic Function and Autoencoder) using Python,
to find out records most suspcious to tax fraudulency. Those anomalies can be investigated further to identify potential real estate fraud.

2. Outline
> Data Cleaning: We filled the missing values with mean/median/mode of the group the missing value row belonged to. This ensured the missing fields are filled
with the most typical value.
> Feature engineering: With experts' advices, we created special variables to as best as possible represent the values per square meters of properties, and
the looked for the anomalies.
> Standardization and Normalization: Since original features have different scale, we scaled them before execution of PCA, to reduce dimensions. We kept
only PCs with higher eigenvalues to be our new features, and dropped the rest. Before the conduction of algorithm, we scaled the PCs via z-score again, to
uniform their scales.
> Unsupervised ML Models: We calculated two fraud scores, using Heuristic Function and Autoencoder. Then we ranked the whole data set, leaving only top10
anomalous records with high weighted fraud scores.
